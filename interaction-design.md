## Interaction Design for services

Interaction designers are an essential part of service teams that want to meet user needs. They work closely with the entire project team, especially User Researchers, Service Designers, Content Designers and Software Developers.

Below are some of the activities carried out by Interaction Designers

### Discovery

*   Help the team to create a well defined problem statement 
*   Study the existing service if one exists, (analytics, call centre observations, SME interviews etc) 
*   Understand a users interactions with the any current service
*   Attend user research (listen to phone calls, meet users, observe how they interact with current services etc)
*   Study any third party offerings
*   Help the team to identify and investigate pain points 
*   Identify the riskiest assumptions
*   Help the team to with the creation of user Journey Maps
*   Make plans for Alpha  ('How might we statements', challenge the need for an Alpha, Should there be more than 1 Alpha?)


### Alpha

*   Work out the best way to let users interact with the service
*   Design and test multiple solutions to make sure we build the right thing
*   Test the riskiest assumptions
*   Decide on high-level to be user journeys (online, offline, happy path, sad path etc)
*   Create design ideas based on user research
*   Design mock-ups in Sketch
*   Create prototypes in code
*   Test ideas quickly
*   Work closely with the user researcher and attend user research sessions 
*   Iterate designs based on user feedback 
*   Help the team to challenge any unnecessary questions or requests for information
*   Identify existing patterns that can be reused
*   Communicate design decisions to stakeholders
*   Create flow diagrams for interactions
*   Be an advocate for accessibility in all aspects of the design of the service


### Beta

*   Focus on each screen or stage of the user journey
*   Decide on micro-interactions
*   Iterate and refine ideas based on feedback from users
*   Iterate and refine existing design patterns where needed 
*   Create new design patterns where needed
*   Help the team to test the service with assistive technology
*   Attend user research sessions with users that have accessibility needs
*   Help the team to create a plan for assisted digital users
*   Ensure the service is user-focused, accessible and has a consistent user experience
*   Be an advocate for accessibility in all aspects of the design of a service

### Live and continuous improvement

*   Analyse the service's performance 
*   Use Analytics to identify areas for service improvement
*   Analyse call centre data to identify areas for service improvement
*   Review feedback from the service and feed into new user stories
*   Share new or iterated design patterns in Defra and cross gov
