# Design crits

A design crit is a critique, or detailed analysis of something, not a criticism in order to improve designs. Crits can be done at any stage in the design process and are useful to help improve overall services.

We have a [#design-crits](https://defra-digital.slack.com/archives/C01REPJH9V5) slack channel and offer design crits to anyone who is interested in having them. You can request a design crit via Slack or [the request form](https://forms.gle/nQrFQYzd5sdLjuBK6).

## Tips for getting and giving feedback

### Getting feedback

#### 1. Set the context

* who are the users?
* what do they need?
* what stage is the project at?
* what are our current assumptions?

You can use the [project summary cards](https://github.com/DEFRA/design/raw/master/assets/project-summary-cards.pdf) to help set the context for a crit.

#### 2. Say what kind of feedback you want

* graphic design
* interaction design
* service design
* content design

#### 3. Let the team review the work

* don’t give a demo
* don’t talk too much
* don’t get defensive
* do take notes
* do listen

### Giving feedback

#### 1. Listen to the context

* ask questions if you need to

#### 2. Give the right kind of feedback

* avoid personal opinions
* avoid absolute statements
* ask open questions
* be kind
* explore ideas and suggest alternatives


Instead of:

*“I don’t like X”*  
*“Y never works”*  

Ask:

*“What happens if...”*  
*“Have you tried...”*


You can use the [questions and suggestions form](https://github.com/DEFRA/design/raw/master/assets/questions_and_suggestions.docx) to help provide feedback at a crit.
