## Defra Interaction design standards

Interaction designers determine the best way for users to interact with services, from the overall flow/user journey to individual design elements.

## Prototyping
A prototype should be the quickest, simplest way to learn about something, or to test an idea.

## Design patterns

Design patterns solve the common problems so teams can focus on the things uniques to their service and itâ€™s users.

Check the GOV.UK Design System to see if the component or pattern you need is already being used across government.

If you cannot find what you need in the GOV.UK Design System you can:

* see if it is being worked on by other teams across government and add your findings
* see if it is being worked on by someone in Defra and add your findings 
* propose a new pattern in Defra
* propose a new pattern in the cross gov design system

All patterns must be useful and unique.

### Iterating a design pattern
Existing design patterns can be used as starting points but may need to be iterated to suit the needs of users of a particular service. 

To do this add a class to the component with a Defra namespace.
