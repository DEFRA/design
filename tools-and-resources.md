# Tools and resources

## Components and patterns 

Design patterns solve the common problems so teams can focus on the things unique to their service and itâ€™s users.

Check the [GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/) to see if the component or pattern you need is already being used across government.

If you cannot find what you need in the GOV.UK Design System you can:

* [see if it is being worked on by other teams across government and add your findings](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/community/backlog/)
* [see if it is being worked on by someone in Defra](https://github.com/DEFRA/design-discussions/issues) and add your findings 
* [propose a new pattern in the Defra backlog](https://github.com/DEFRA/design-discussions/issues)
* [propose a new pattern in the GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/community/propose-a-component-or-pattern/). All patterns must be [useful and unique](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/community/contribution-criteria/#new-proposals).

* Check other departments for [design patterns and design resources](https://github.com/ctdesign/gov-design-systems-list)

### Gov.uk Prototype kit

Use the Gov.uk Prototype kit to produce working prototypes.

Use the Defra [GitHub account](https://github.com/defra) for version control and sharing code, to get a repo set up contact [Cathy Dutton](mailto:cathy.dutton@environment-agency.gov.uk).

To get an account you must set up [two factor authentication](https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-two-factor-authentication).
