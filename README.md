# Interaction Design in Defra

Interaction designers design the detailed actions a user needs to make in order to use a service. They are comfortable working at both ends of the scale, from high level flows and journeys to the detail of individual elements on screen. 


#### DDaT definition:

An interaction designer works out the best way to let users interact with services, in terms of both overall flow and at the level of individual design elements.


### Scope

* user journeys 
* actions
* tasks

* mid level - Flow diagram, Interaction sequence, Screen sequence, Question sequence
* low level - Structure, Screen layout, Components


### Goal

* visualise a users perspective

* design how users interact with services

### focus

* users
* context
* situations
* when/where
